    "- loop (comprehension) a list of lists for the keyword for searches. eg. search=[['covid19','risk','factor','incubation']]\n",
    "- stem the keywords so incubation becomes incubat etc.\n",
    "- append indpendently - different variations of corona references - (covid, cov, -cov, hcov) to the keywords avoids pulling older research\n",

    "- if sentence has all keywords, it is added to the df for display.\n",

    "**Cons:** Currently the system requires some human understanding in crafting keyword combinations, however, the recent relevance measure changes and stemming of keywords, have made it so the keywords can be very close to the NL questions and return very good results.\n"
