    "- open the meta CSV file in a dataframe - 44K entries\n",
    "- drop the duplicates by abstract\n",
    "- loop (comprehension) a list of lists for the keyword for searches. eg. search=[['incubation','period','range']]\n",
    "- stem the keywords so incubation becomes incubat etc.\n",
    "- append indpendently - different variations of corona references - (covid, cov, -cov, hcov) to the keywords avoids pulling older research\n",
    "- query function in pandas to query the above terms with the keywords - the abstract has to have all the keywords and at least one of (covid, cov, -cov, hcov) \n",
    "- drop the duplicates in the df again after the queries\n",
    "- caclulate a relevance score for all the abstracts in the query result df\n",

    "- final_score = (raw_score/len(abstract))*raw_score\n",
    "- sort the df on the final_score ascending=False (best on top)\n",
    "- drop rows with a relevance score < .02\n",
    "- parse the relevant abstarcts into sentences split('. ') works well.\n",
    "- test if keywords are in the sentences\n",
    "- if sentence has all keywords, it is added to the df for display.\n",

    "**Pros:** Currently the system is a very simple **(as Einstein said \"make it as simple as possible, but no simpler\")**, but quite effective solutiuon to providing insight on topical queries.  The code is easy to read and simple to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:** Currently the system requires some human understanding in crafting keyword combinations, however, the recent relevance measure changes and stemming of keywords, have made it so the keywords can be very close to the NL questions and return very good results.\n"
