# In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the White House and a coalition of leading research groups have prepared the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19). CORD-19 is a resource of over 200,000 scholarly articles, including over 90,000 with full text, about COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and related coronaviruses. This freely available dataset is provided to the global research community to apply recent advances in natural language processing and other AI techniques to generate new insights in support of the ongoing fight against this infectious disease. There is a growing urgency for these approaches because of the rapid acceleration in new coronavirus literature, making it difficult for the medical research community to keep up.
# solved the dataset by using NlTK

## Tasks
# What is known about transmission, incubation, and environmental stability?
# What do we know about COVID-19 risk factors?
# What do we know about vaccines and therapeutics?
# What do we know about virus genetics, origin, and evolution?
